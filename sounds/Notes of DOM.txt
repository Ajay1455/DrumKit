Meine abhi itna hi type kia hai tumhare liye jitna ki class mein kraaya

DOM = Document Object Model
         
      Document = means full html
      
      Object = as we know everything in js is object
    
      Model = tree-like structure to make it easier to access and manage the elements 
              like dom have its own model like html is main parents and it has 2 childrens 
                1. Head
                2. Body

1. how to select any element by id

 document.getElementById("id of any element") --- now this means it select the element with the id u put.

 now u can store this in any variable

 step 1. like this.  var a = document.getElementById("id of any element");
            
 step 2. now u can see by console.log(a) --> to see which element is select

 step 3. now u can change the selected element html or style like this...
         
          this is to change html 
          a.innerHTML="Any text u want to replace with selected element ";
 
          this is use to change in css
          a.style.color="any color u want to change ";



After this now move to advance Level

* Now lets change the link of any anchor tag

 first of all we have to store selected element to any variable 
 then we can its href(where we type link) .


@ Suppose this is the anchor tag

<a id="anchor" class="hot" href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>


this tag link open google and let suppose we have to change this link to instagram

var e=(document.getElementById("anchor"));

         e.setAttribute(     "href"  ,    "https://www.instagram.com/   ");
                                ^                        ^
                                |                        |
                      this is attribute            this is what we want to change
                         of element


Events :

1. click event in inline js and external js.
   
    first store target element .for eg. 
    var a= getElementById("id of target element");

    then use a event named : onclick then assigned it with an function like this
    a.onclick=(function(){ console.log("this is click event ") })
  


a. DOM CREATE METHODS:

  1. to create tag -> createElement
      ex.1 var newElement =document.createElement("h2");     

  2. to create text -> createTextNode
  3. to create comment -> createComment



b. DOM Append Methods:

  1. to append text in p tag -> appendChild

     ex.1 var Txt = document.createTextNode("Text ,which we want to append")
          var element =document.createElement("h2"); 

          element.appendChild(Txt); => in this newText is inserted in element .
 
          document.getElementById("id of element").appendChild(element);


 2. insertBefore having two arguments 1. what to append 2. before which element to append.

    ex1: target.insertBefore(element, document.getElementById("txt").childNodes[0]);





2. Event listener

Add events like alert something while click on something or hover something.

document.querySelector("element") = obj(this is called obj).

@ Syntax : obj.addEventListener("event" , function or callfunction);
  ex1. document.querySelector("target element").addEventListener("click", handleClick);
       function handleClick(){
       alert("I got clicked! ");
       };

Now one question if u understand Event listener.
question 1. button to change css of background color



3. onInput.
